A repository of autnonoums self-driving vehicles articles, dataset, software and more.

## Overview
Traditional autonomous driving technology divides autonomous driving pipeline into several different functions such as perception, localization & mapping, prediction, planning, and control. However, modern architecture encapsulates entire pipeline tasks into a single module, leveraging an end-to-end deep neural network for high integration level.
