# :ok_hand: Awesome Self-Driving Cars - AV & ADAS :car:

AV software development has traditionally been based on a modular approach, with separate components for object detection and tracking, mapping & localization, trajectory prediction, and path planning and control. However, modern architecture encapsulates entire pipeline tasks into a single module, leveraging an end-to-end deep neural network for high integration level.

This is a repository of Autonomous Vechicles (AV) & Advanced Driving Assistance Systems (ADAS) articles, dataset, algorithms, hardware and more.
