## Prediction

Prediction provides future trajectories of observed movable objects. During planning, this information is processed and then future trajectory ego vehicle.

### Prediction methods


### Prediction metrics

The most common prediction quality measures are,
- Average Displacement Error (ADE - mean L2 distance between all trajectory points)
- Final Displacement Error (FDE - L2 distance between final trajectory points)
