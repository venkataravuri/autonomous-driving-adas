# Simulation

Self-driving cars can’t be trained in real-world scenarios or roads because they will be extremely dangerous. Instead, self-driving cars are trained on a simulator where there’s no risk at all. 

## Open-source Simulators

| Simulator | Description | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [CARLA Simulator](https://carla.org/) | An open-source simulator for autonomous driving research. CARLA supportd development, training, and validation of autonomous driving systems. | |
| [SUMMIT Simulator](https://github.com/AdaCompNUS/summit)​​ | SUMMIT (Simulator for Urban Driving in Massive Mixed Traffic) is an open-source simulator with a focus on generating high-fidelity, interactive data for unregulated, dense urban traffic on complex real-world maps. It works with map data in the form of OSM files and SUMO networks to generate crowds of heterogeneous traffic agents with sophisticated and realistic unregulated behaviors. | |
| [AirSim](https://microsoft.github.io/AirSim/) | AirSim is a simulator for drones, cars and more, built on Unreal Engine. It is open-source, cross platform, and supports software-in-the-loop simulation with popular flight controllers such as PX4 & ArduPilot and hardware-in-loop with PX4 for physically and visually realistic simulations. It is developed as an Unreal plugin that can simply be dropped into any Unreal environment. | |
| [DeepDrive](https://deepdrive.io/index.html) | Deepdrive is a simulator that allows anyone with a PC to push the state-of-the-art in self-driving. | |
| [Flow](https://flow-project.github.io/) | A deep reinforcement learning frameworkfor mixed autonomy traffic. Developed by UC Berkeley. | |
