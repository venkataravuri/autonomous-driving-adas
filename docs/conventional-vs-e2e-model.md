# AV1.0 vs. AV2.0 - Conventional AV vs. E2E Neural Network Model
The modern Autononoums driving architectures today replacing conventional modular pipeline tasks, with separate components for object detection and tracking, mapping & localization, trajectory prediction, and path planning and control with end-to-end AI models encapsulating entire pipeline tasks into a single module, leveraging an end-to-end deep neural networks.
