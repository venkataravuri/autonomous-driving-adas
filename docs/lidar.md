# LiDAR - Light Detection and Ranging

LiDAR sensors capture millions of data points per second, creating dense point clouds that represent the vehicle's surroundings in three dimensions.

The main idea of a LiDAR instrument is that it's built to measure distance directly. They send a light wave to the world, and measure the time it takes to reflect and come back. For more about it refer to, [Types of Lidar](https://www.thinkautonomous.ai/blog/types-of-lidar/)

point clouds are rich in spatial information, they lack semantic context

> RADARs measure the world by sending radio waves, and SONARs sending sound waves, LiDAR do it using light waves.

## Annotation & Labeling LiDAR Data

LiDAR point cloud data requires annotation and labeling to be useful for training autonomous vehicles.

- Object Detection: Annotators identify and label objects within the point cloud, including cars, pedestrians, cyclists, and other relevant objects.
- Semantic Segmentation: Assigning a label to each point in the cloud, creating a pixel-wise segmentation of objects and their boundaries.
- Instance Segmentation: Separating individual instances of the same object class, such as distinguishing between different vehicles.
- 3D Bounding Boxes: Defining 3D bounding boxes around objects, including their dimensions, orientation, and location in 3D space.
- Lane and Road Markings: Annotating the road layout, lane markings, and other navigational information.
