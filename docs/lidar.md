# LiDAR - Light Detection and Ranging

LiDAR sensors capture millions of data points per second, creating dense point clouds that represent the vehicle's surroundings in three dimensions

point clouds are rich in spatial information, they lack semantic context

LiDAR point cloud data requires annotation and labeling to be useful for training autonomous vehicles.

## Annotation & Labeling LiDAR Data

- Object Detection: Annotators identify and label objects within the point cloud, including cars, pedestrians, cyclists, and other relevant objects.
- Semantic Segmentation: Assigning a label to each point in the cloud, creating a pixel-wise segmentation of objects and their boundaries.
- Instance Segmentation: Separating individual instances of the same object class, such as distinguishing between different vehicles.
- 3D Bounding Boxes: Defining 3D bounding boxes around objects, including their dimensions, orientation, and location in 3D space.
- Lane and Road Markings: Annotating the road layout, lane markings, and other navigational information.
