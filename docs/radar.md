## RADAR

Radar stands for Radio Detection And Ranging.

### Physics of Radar

Radar radio frequency (RF) generator emits electromagnetic waves and its receiver picks up, filters and processes the waves rebounded from the metal surfaces or other reflecting materials. The distance to the objects is measured by multiplying speed of the radio wave (speed of light~300,000 km/s) by half of the propagation time (transmission time + receiving time).

#### What are applications of radar?
Some applications of radar are in adaptive cruise control (ACC), predictive emergency braking (PEBS) and blind-spot monitoring (BSM) systems.

#### What are different types of radar?

There are different types of radars based on the range and beam angle. In the past the main types were short-range radars (SRR) in the ~24 GHz frequency band and long-range radars (LRR) in the ~76 GHz frequency band. But the applications are merging and some radars cover both ranges known as mid-range radars (MRR) in the 76 to 81 GHz. Eventually MRRs are expected to dominate the market supplemented by a LRR. Short-range radars typically have a range of 20–50 meters and a beam angle of up to 160 degrees. Long-range radars have ranges of 250 m and beam angles of up to 30 degrees. Mid-range radars have ranges of 100–150m and a beam angle in between.

#### What is doppler effect?
Radar can also measure the relative speed of all the detected objects using the doppler shift of the reflected electromagnetic wave as well as the transverse offset with an angle estimation.
