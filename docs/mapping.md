# Mapping & Localization

## Mapping

### Algorithms

 PoseNet and VLocNet++, are some of the frameworks that use point data to estimate the 3D position and orientation. These estimated 3D positions and orientations can be used to derive scene semantics, as seen in the image below. 

## Localization

Localization algorithms in self-driving cars calculate the position and orientation of the vehicle as it navigates â€“ a science known as Visual Odometry (VO).

VO works by matching key points in consecutive video frames. With each frame, the key points are used as the input to a mapping algorithm. The mapping algorithm, such as Simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), computes the position and orientation of each object nearby with respect to the previous frame and helps to classify roads, pedestrians, and other objects around.
